# 🔐 Cryptography Algorithms Practice

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of cryptographic algorithm implementations, structured across four major parts as part of a hands-on exploration of classical and modern cryptography concepts.

Each part focuses on different classes of cryptographic techniques — from simple substitution ciphers to public-key cryptography and secure hashing algorithms. The project serves both as a reference and practice material for understanding the fundamentals of cryptography.
